## Welcome to My Operating System Class Repository

### I'm Agus Tini Sridewi, a student of the Operating System class, and my NPM is 2306276004.

I'm excited to share my learning journey and look forward to collaborating and growing together as we explore the fascinating world of Operating Systems.
