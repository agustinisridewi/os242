## Week 04: Addressing, Shared Lib, & Pointer
- [slide](https://docos.vlsm.org/Slides/os04.pdf) containing materials provided by C. BinKadal. In Linux, shared libraries are collections of precompiled functions that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. They are loaded into memory only once and shared by all running programs, which reduces the overall memory footprint.
